					<li>Regular money transfers are usually available within minutes for pick up by the receiver, subject to hours of operation of the paying agent location.

To comply, Western Union is required to screen all transactions against lists of names provided by the governments of the countries in which we do business, including the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the European Union. If a potential match is identified, Western Union must research the transaction to determine if the individual matched is in fact the individual on the relevant list. On occasion, customers are required to provide additional identification or information. Transactions may thus be delayed. This is a legal requirement for all transactions processed by Western Unio (inclusive of transfers that originate and terminate outside of the US).</li>
